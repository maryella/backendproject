# Winery Review Site

### Back-end focused project for Digital Crafts August 2019 Cohort.

Built using Node/Express and PostgreSQL.

Views handled server side by Express using ES6 Render Templates. (Highly recommend this view engine!)

Allows users to sign up and add reviews to wineries they've visited - or even add their favorite winery if it's not listed.

Visitors who are not logged in can still see wineries & reviews but cannot make any additions or alterations.
