JavaScript | Express | Node | PostgreSQL | Bootstrap | Express ES6 Template Engine

### The Premise
North Georgia has a surprising number of wineries. As interest in local products grows, it would be helpful to have easily accessible information on these wineries for people interested in patronizing them. Reviews allow users to share their experience and better prepare other for future visits. 


### The Tech
Routes built using Node/Express.

Views handled server side by Express using ES6 Template Engine and styled using Bootstrap.

Data for both users and wineries stored on PostgreSQL database, communicating with web app via pg-promise. User passwords in the database were protected using bcrypt-js (with salt and hash), which seemed sufficient security for this type of casual application.
